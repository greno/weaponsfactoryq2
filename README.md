# Weapons Factory for Quake 2

Released in 1998, my brother Tom Reno and I released a mod for Quake 2 called Weapons Factory. It had quite a following, and at one point had 50 servers hosting the mod.  Over the years, Weapons Factory has been ported and played on many game engines, including:

 - Quake 2
 - Quake 3 Arena
 - Unreal Tournament
 - Half-Life
 - Tribes

On this the 25th anniversary of WF for Q2, I am releasing the source code for **version 4.2.1**.  Not that I was holding on to it for any reason.  It's just I forgot about it for years until I was recently reminded by a group of dedicated WF players over at [Weapons Factory Arena] (http://weaponsfactoryarena.com) and [Weapons Factory Roblox](https://www.weaponsfactoryroblox.com/)that it would be a good idea to do so.

Also included are the original client, server and map files.

Weapons Factory was such a blast work on, and I am humbled by the awesome community who loved playing the game as much as I loved working on it.  Thank you to all the players and developers who made Weapons Factory so great.
